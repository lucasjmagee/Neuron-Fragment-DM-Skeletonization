**Full Brain Neuron Fragment 2D Discrete Morse Graph Reconstruction Python Package**

I. Package Description

- DiMo2d is a python package meant for executing the discrete Morse graph reconstruction algorithm on the DM++ likelihood outputs of 2D neuron images. The package includes functions which allows users to compute persistence diagrams, generate a discrete Morse graph reconstruction, postprocess the graph reconstruction to capture neuronal fragments, and output the graphs to different formats for each image.
